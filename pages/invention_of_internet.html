                                            The first recorded description of the social interactions that could be
                                            enabled through networking
                                            was a series of memos written by J.C.R. Licklider of MIT in August 1962
                                            discussing his “Galactic Network” concept. He envisioned a globally
                                            interconnected set of computers through which everyone could quickly access
                                            data and programs from any site. In spirit, the concept was very much like
                                            the Internet of today. Licklider was the first head of the computer research
                                            program at DARPA,4 starting in October 1962. While at DARPA he convinced his
                                            successors at DARPA, Ivan
                                            Sutherland, Bob Taylor, and MIT researcher Lawrence G. Roberts, of the
                                            importance of
                                            this networking concept.
                                            Leonard Kleinrock at MIT published the first paper on packet switching
                                            theory in July
                                            1961 and the first book on the subject in 1964. Kleinrock convinced Roberts
                                            of the theoretical
                                            feasibility of communications using packets rather than circuits, which was
                                            a major step along the
                                            path towards computer networking. The other key step was to make the
                                            computers talk together. To explore
                                            this, in 1965 working with Thomas Merrill, Roberts connected the TX-2
                                            computer in Mass. to the Q-32 in
                                            California with a low speed dial-up telephone line creating the first
                                            (however small) wide-area computer
                                            network ever built. The result of this experiment was the realization that
                                            the time-shared computers could
                                            work well together, running programs and retrieving data as necessary on the
                                            remote machine, but that the
                                            circuit switched telephone system was totally inadequate for the job.
                                            Kleinrock’s conviction of the need for packet switching was confirmed.
                                            In late 1966 Roberts went to DARPA to develop the computer network concept
                                            and quickly put together his
                                            plan for the “ARPANET”, publishing it in 1967. At the conference where he
                                            presented the paper, there was
                                            also a paper on a packet network concept from the UK by Donald Davies and
                                            Roger Scantlebury of NPL.
                                            Scantlebury told Roberts about the NPL work as well as that of Paul Baran
                                            and others at RAND. The RAND
                                            group had written a paper on packet switching networks for secure voice in
                                            the military in 1964.
                                            It happened that the work at MIT (1961-1967), at RAND (1962-1965), and at
                                            NPL (1964-1967) had all
                                            proceeded in parallel without any of the researchers knowing about the other
                                            work. The word “packet” was
                                            adopted from the work at NPL and the proposed
                                            line speed to be used in the ARPANET design was upgraded from 2.4 kbps to 50
                                            kbps. 5
                                            In August 1968, after Roberts and the DARPA funded community had refined the
                                            overall structure and
                                            specifications for the ARPANET, an RFQ was released by DARPA for the
                                            development of one of the key components,
                                            the packet switches called Interface Message Processors (IMP’s). The RFQ was
                                            won in December 1968 by a group
                                            headed by Frank Heart at Bolt Beranek and Newman (BBN). As the BBN team
                                            worked on the IMP’s with Bob Kahn
                                            playing a major role in the overall ARPANET architectural design, the
                                            network topology and economics were
                                            designed and optimized by Roberts working with Howard Frank and his team at
                                            Network Analysis Corporation,
                                            and the network measurement system was prepared by Kleinrock’s team at UCLA.
                                            6
                                            Due to Kleinrock’s early development of packet switching theory and his
                                            focus on analysis, design and
                                            measurement, his Network Measurement Center at UCLA was selected to be the
                                            first node on the ARPANET.
                                            All this came together in September 1969 when BBN installed the first IMP at
                                            UCLA and the first host
                                            computer was connected. Doug Engelbart’s project on “Augmentation of Human
                                            Intellect”
                                            (which included NLS, an early hypertext system) at Stanford Research
                                            Institute (SRI)
                                            provided a second node. SRI supported the Network Information Center, led by
                                            Elizabeth (Jake)
                                            Feinler and including functions such as maintaining tables of host name to
                                            address mapping as well
                                            as a directory of the RFC’s.

                                            <!-- One month later, when SRI was connected to the ARPANET, the first host-to-host message was sent from Kleinrock’s laboratory to SRI. Two more nodes were added at UC Santa Barbara and University of Utah. These last two nodes incorporated application visualization projects, with Glen Culler and Burton Fried at UCSB investigating methods for display of mathematical functions using storage displays to deal with the problem of refresh over the net, and Robert Taylor and Ivan Sutherland at Utah investigating methods of 3-D representations over the net. Thus, by the end of 1969, four host computers were connected together into the initial ARPANET, and the budding Internet was off the ground. Even at this early stage, it should be noted that the networking research incorporated both work on the underlying network and work on how to utilize the network. This tradition continues to this day. -->

                                            <!-- Computers were added quickly to the ARPANET during the following years, and work proceeded on completing a functionally complete Host-to-Host protocol and other network software. In December 1970 the Network Working Group (NWG) working under S. Crocker finished the initial ARPANET Host-to-Host protocol, called the Network Control Protocol (NCP). As the ARPANET sites completed implementing NCP during the period 1971-1972, the network users finally could begin to develop applications. -->

                                            <!-- In October 1972, Kahn organized a large, very successful demonstration of the ARPANET at the International Computer Communication Conference (ICCC). This was the first public demonstration of this new network technology to the public. It was also in 1972 that the initial “hot” application, electronic mail, was introduced. In March Ray Tomlinson at BBN wrote the basic email message send and read software, motivated by the need of the ARPANET developers for an easy coordination mechanism. In July, Roberts expanded its utility by writing the first email utility program to list, selectively read, file, forward, and respond to messages. From there email took off as the largest network application for over a decade. This was a harbinger of the kind of activity we see on the World Wide Web today, namely, the enormous growth of all kinds of “people-to-people” traffic. -->

                                            1) Information sharing over the Internet will be so effortlessly interwoven
                                            into daily life that it will become invisible, flowing like electricity,
                                            often through machine intermediaries.
                                            2) The spread of the Internet will enhance global connectivity that fosters
                                            more planetary relationships and less ignorance.
                                            3) The Internet of Things, artificial intelligence, and big data will make
                                            people more aware of their world and their own behavior.
                                            4) Augmented reality and wearable devices will be implemented to monitor and
                                            give quick feedback on daily life, especially tied to personal health.
                                            5) Political awareness and action will be facilitated and more peaceful
                                            change and public uprisings like the Arab Spring will emerge.
